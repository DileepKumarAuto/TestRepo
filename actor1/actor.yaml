# A string that specifies the type of actor that will be created. This
# can be any string - as long as the same string is going to be used in
# the test definition files - but it's recommended to use an uppercase
# three-letter string (e.g. WEB, MOB, API, etc.)
actorType: ACTOR1

# Actor tags can be used to determine what test actor will execute a particular
# test session when multiple actors of the required type are available.
