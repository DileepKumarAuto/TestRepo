  Verifies that GitHub repos have non-empty wiki pages. This test demonstrates
  two major features of OpenTest: data-driven testing and macro actions.
  Data-driven tests are created by populating the dataSet property of the test
  with an array of data records to iterate on. The data records can be simple
  strings or other primitive values (as we have in this test), or complex objects
  with multiple properties (fields).
dataSet: ["facebook/react", "tesseract-ocr/tesseract"]
actors:
  - actor: ACTOR1
    segments:
      - segment: 1
        actions:
          # The action below is a so-called "macro action", which can contain
          # multiple regular actions and scripts. You can find its definition
          # in the "macros" directory
          - macro: github.AssertRepoHasNonEmptyWiki
            args:
              repo: $dataRecord
